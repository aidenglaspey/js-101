# [fit] Intro to Programming

## SWBAT (Students Will Be Able To)

- Grasp the basic concepts of what programming is
- Understand what Javascript is used for
- Understand the goals of the TODO application
- Grasp and practice the basics of Javascript syntax
- Complete an assessment and extra credit assignment

## Basics of programming

- We will be covering in this section a very high level overview of what programming is
- From here on out, any terminology will be **bolded**
- Code will be displayed in `monospace`.

---

## Code

- **Source Code** or just **Code**, is a set of special instructions a computer reads in order to know what tasks to perform
- Usually, this code is saved in a file, although for javascript we can also type it into the browser for either practice or debugging purposes (more on this later)
- **Computer Language** or **Syntax**, are the rules for the valid format of this language

`var student = 'Tom';` is valid Javascript

`varr student 'Tom';` is not and will result in the computer throwing it's hands up in the air

---

## Expressions

- An **Expression** is any reference to a value, or a set of value(s) and/or value(s) combined with operators
- For example:
  - `a = b * 2;`
  - `a` and `b` are called **variable expression**
      - means retrieve it's current value

---

## Expressions

- For example:
  - `a = b * 2;`
  - `2` is a **literal value expression**
      - it is named as such because it is not stored inside of a variable
  - `b * 2` is an **arithmetic expression**
  - `a = b * 2` is an **assignment expression**

---

## Statements

- In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is called a **Statement**
- It is a collection of expressions
- Example
  - `a = 4 * 2;`
  - `a` and `b` are called a **variable**
      - boxes that hold values
  - `=` and `*` are operators
      - they perform actions
- Most statements in Javascript conclude with a semicolon

  - `a = 4 * 2;`

## Executing a Program

- So how does the computer interpret all this?
- The statements in the above examples are helpful for us to read, but the computer can't actually read that as written
- To be "executed" a special utility on the computer is used to translate the code into **machine language** the computer can understand
    - One such utility is an "compiler" that translates Javascript into machine-readable code

Let's try a bit of code before we continue

- Open your favorite browser (not IE)
- Open the console on any page
    - either in "settings" or try "cmd/ctrl + opt/alt + j"

# Javascript

- The history of [Javascript](https://embedwistia-a.akamaihd.net/deliveries/02b2a82f133a6d2c55210097cfb6e0daa04cf380/file.mp4)
- How HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together
- How you add it to the browser
    - take a look at adding-js.html
