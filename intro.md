## However...

I must warn you....

---

- Javascript...
  - can be confusing
  - can be difficult to learn
  - can be too abstract to grasp easily

---

- you can't be afraid to fail
- to get back up
- and to try again

## Basic Structure of Class

- Notes will be available at github.com/robaguilera/js-101
  - the repo is private so you'll have to be added to it (most of you already are)
- I will cover a topic in class
  - we will follow a code example together as a class
  - you then will be given a mini exercise to complete on your own
  - we will reconvene to go over the answer and then move on

---

## Basic Structure of Class

- At then end of each class you'll be given either
  - an assessment to complete at the end of class (if we run out of time it will be assigned as homework)
  - an extra credit assignment if you want more practice
  - or a reading assignment
  - notes on grades....
